	glad we made
	ad w

       ii)tee command:
	alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~$ ls -l employee.txt | wc | tee count.txt

       iii)watch command:
	watch -n 5 date (for every 5 seconds date gets updated)
	Every 5.0s: date              alchemy-virtual-machine: Mon Sep 28 21:20:26 2020

f1=/home/alchemy/file1.txt
f2=/home/alchemy/file2.txt
if cmp -s "$f1""$f2";
then 
echo "both equal"
else
echo "mismatched"
fi

alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~$ cat file1.txt
padmini 
i completed gradution
alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~$ cat file2.txt
padmini is graduated
alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~$ bash 4.sh
mismatched

5.Write a shell script for finding the cubic value of a given number 
(A)
#! /bin/bash
echo "enter number"
read num
echo "cube of given $num :`expr "$num" \* "$num" \* "$num"`"

alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~$ bash 5.sh
enter number
4
cube of given 4 :64
 
6.Write a Shell script for getting word count of a file.If file is not exist in the path, then the script has to exit and return the error code.

then
  echo -n "no of words are :" cat ${file} | wc -w
else
  echo ${?}
  echo "not found"
  exit 1 
fi 


alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~$ ./6.sh /home/alchemy/file1.txt
7
alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~$ ./6.sh /home/alchemy/file1000.txt
1
not found
