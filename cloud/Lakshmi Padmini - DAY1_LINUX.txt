1.What is Shared and unbindable mountpoints?

Mount point defines the place of a particular dataset in the filesystem.
The shared mountpoint is about managing propogation of mounts between peer mounts of different namespaces.
This can be replicated as many times as needed, where each copy will be same.Under this some subdirectory
will appear in all the replicated mountpoints.
Unbindable mountpoint is also like private unmountpoint,it cannot be replicsted elsewhere through the use of the 
bind flag of the mount system call or the command

2.Create a directory ‘dir1’ in which you have three files. All the file should have some texts related to banking.
Now count every occurrence of the term “bank” in all the files appearing under the directory ‘dir1’.

grep -o -i bank * | wc -l 

alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~/t2/test$ cat f1
A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans.[1] Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. 
alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~/t2/test$ cat f2
bank is a financial institute
alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~/t2/test$ cat f3
we have different types of bank. the bank is classified on various things.
alchemy@alchemy-virtual-machine:~/t2/test$ grep -o -i bank * | wc -l
